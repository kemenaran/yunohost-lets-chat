  "readme": "Helmet's crossdomain.xml middleware\n===================================\n\nAdobe defines [the spec for crossdomain.xml](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/articles/crossdomain_policy_file_spec.html), a policy file that grants some Adobe products (like Flash) read access to resources on your domain. An unrestrictive policy could let others load things off your domain that you don't want.\n\nTo serve up a restrictive policy:\n\n```javascript\nvar crossdomain = require('helmet-crossdomain');\napp.use(crossdomain());\n```\n\nThis serves the policy at `/crossdomain.xml`. By default, this is case-insensitive. To make it case-sensitive:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(crossdomain({ caseSensitive: true }));\n// This will now ONLY match all-lowercase /crossdomain.xml.\n```\n\nThis doesn't make you wildly more secure, but it does help to keep Flash from loading things that you don't want it to. You might also *want* some of this behavior, in which case you should make your own less-restrictive policy and serve it.\n",
