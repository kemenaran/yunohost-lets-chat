This will (try to) abolish all client-side caching.\n\n```javascript\nvar nocache = require('nocache');\napp.use(nocache());\n```\n\nThis will set `Cache-Control` and `Pragma` headers to stop caching. It will also set an `Expires` header of 0, effectively saying \"this has already expired.\"\n\nIf you want to crush the `ETag` header as well, you can:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(nocache({ noEtag: true }));\n```\n\nCaching has some real benefits, and you lose them here. Browsers won't cache resources with this enabled, although *some* performance is retained if you keep ETag support. It's also possible that you'll introduce *new* bugs and you'll wish people had old resources cached, but that's less likely.\n",
