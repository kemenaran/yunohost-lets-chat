Rivest in 1991. I needed a\nnpm package of the algorithm, so I used Jeff’s implementation for this package.\nThe original implementation can be found in the\n[CryptoJS](http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) project.\n\n\n## License\n\n~~~\nCopyright © 2011-2012, Paul Vorbach.\nCopyright © 2009, Jeff Mott.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or\n  other materials provided with the distribution.\n* Neither the name Crypto-JS nor the names of its contributors may be used to\n  endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior\n  written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
